There are two programs: change_srate and change_freq. 
The first changes sampling rate very quickly and the second changes receiver frequency.

When running change_srate, the following error is shown after a while: 

```
UHD Error:
    recv packet demuxer unexpected sid 0x1fffe

UHD Error:
    recv packet demuxer unexpected sid 0x30003
```

This error is not seen when changing the receiver frequency very quickly.
